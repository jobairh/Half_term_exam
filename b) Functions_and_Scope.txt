Local Variables: A local Variable Accessible within the function where they are defined and it is exists only during the function exexution.
For example:
	def my_var():
    	local_var = 5  # Local variable
    	print(local_var)  # Accessing local variable

Global Variabels: A Global Variable accessible throuhout the whole program, including all functions and defined outside any function or class. That Variable ends for the duration of the program's execution.
For example:
	global_var = 10  # Global variable
	def my_var():
    	print(global_var)  # Accessing global variable

NonLocal Variable: nonlocal assigns to variables in an outer scope, but not a global scope.
For example:
	def outer():
    	    x = “local”
 
    	def inner():
             nonlocal x
             x = “nonlocal”
             print(“inner:”, x)
 
    	inner()
    	print(“outer:”, x)
